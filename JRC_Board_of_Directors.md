# Intro

This is a formalised exposé of the Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as you can see in an image we will soon cover, and also there will be a section dedicated the founder Mathew Isreal who is a man who should be viewed in similar regard to [Josef Mengele](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele) or even [Hans Aspberger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/hans-asperger-aided-and-supported-nazi-programme-study-says) himself. But lets not get ahead of ourselves... Why is Mathew no longer on the board, and who are these other people, and what role do they play?

All sources that are directly in the control of JRC will be archived and screenshots, so we do not increase web traffic towards JRC, which means that increased foot traffic wont ring any alarm bells if they could link back to this GitHub. And if those bastards ever try any defermation suits they can bite my ass because everything I say here is just the truth. I have no need to warp reality, these bastards have already been condemned by the [United Nations](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/a909d4b5254b4ddf75764431cd8352c5ce3ede68/Page%2083%20&%2084%20of%20report-of-the-special-rapporteur-on-torture.pdf) and are all complicit in what I would personally in my opinion consider, [Crimes Against Humanity](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/b031c722d63ae60aaea27c685a50a3d36a064864/Page%2010%20&%2011%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court.pdf), as defined by the United Nations themselves.

For this reason, I refuse to respect the Doctor titles of any of these individuals as they break the sacred vowels of the hippocratic oath (in my opnion). Which I just found out right now... that the modern version actually does not contain "do no harm", which is actually quite troubling... [Here is some more infomation, if you would like to read about it.](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html) However I feel that the Board of Directors and Mathew Israel most certainly violate this oath regardless of it not being the same oath as exists in popular imagination.

# Hippocratic Oath

>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
>
>I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
>
>I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, **avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.**
>
>I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and **that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.**
>
>I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
>
>I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. **Above all, I must not play at God.**
>
>**I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being**, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
>
>I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
>
>**I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.**
>
>**If I do not violate this oath**, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH: MODERN VERSION, by Louis Lasagna in 1964.

# Who is on the Board of Directors?

[Archived Board of Directors Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20221220070907/https://www.judgerc.org/board-of-directors.html)

As we can see, these are the current, Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as of 2022. We are going to go through each of these peoples histories and find out the extent of political corruption (speculation for legal reasons) and how the fingers of capital are very much... in this "pie". (Speculation for legal reasons) :P

Not looking great already... Well if you try the archived page you will find out that half of the links are dead. However... Luckily this is the internet and nothing is actually lost; So I actually have all the PDF files on this page that are referenced for quick and easy access:

**These files are too big too be uploaded to GitHub, but I have a Dropbox link for people who wish to read them:**

[Treatment of Aggression with Behavioral Programming that Includes Supplementary Skin-Shock](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gqf6guraowzlfpw/Treatment%20of%20Aggression%20with%20Behavioral%20Programming%20that%20Includes%20Supplementary%20Contingent%20Skin-Shock.pdf?dl=0) 

↑ (Please check this out, if you don't want to read everything, just skip to the charts... I feel like this shit had some fuckcunt salavating as they read it out. Literally fucking disgusting.)

I don't expect many will read any of these, but the preservation of vital infomation is necessary to build a complete arsonal to annihilate Judge Rotenburg Center. And something tells me that JRC let these links die because they would rather make it as hard as possible for people to find out about what this facility actually does, and has done for almost over 50 years now. I consider making these easier to access a nice middle finger towards Mathew Israel and the Board themselves.

# Henry Slucki

Henry Slucki, is an elderly man who has quite a long history, and an undeniably tragic history, as he was a [Jewish Holocaust Survivor](https://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/oral-histories/interviews/woh-fi-0000372/henry-slucki-2013). This fact must be prefaced with the utmost clarifaction that my criticism of Henry Slucki have nothing to do with Judaism or has anything to do with anti-semitic conspiracy theories; because I actually like facts and reason. But I will call Henry somewhat hypocritical for being on the board of directors of JRC while having both his politics and his particular life experiences.
