# Intro

This is a formalised exposé of the Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as you can see in an image we will soon cover, and also there will be a section dedicated the founder Mathew Isreal who is a man who should be viewed in similar regard to [Josef Mengele](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele) or even [Hans Asperger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/hans-asperger-aided-and-supported-nazi-programme-study-says) himself. But lets not get ahead of ourselves... Why is Mathew no longer on the board, and who are these other people, and what role do they play?

All sources that are directly in the control of JRC will be archived and screenshots, so we do not increase web traffic towards JRC, which means that increased foot traffic wont ring any alarm bells if they could link back to this GitHub. And if those bastards ever try any defermation suits they can bite my ass because everything I say here is just the truth. I have no need to warp reality, these bastards have already been condemned by the [United Nations](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/a909d4b5254b4ddf75764431cd8352c5ce3ede68/Page%2083%20&%2084%20of%20report-of-the-special-rapporteur-on-torture.pdf) and are all complicit in what I would personally in my opinion consider, [Crimes Against Humanity](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/b031c722d63ae60aaea27c685a50a3d36a064864/Page%2010%20&%2011%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court.pdf), as defined by the United Nations themselves.

For this reason, I refuse to respect the Doctor titles of any of these individuals as they break the sacred vowels of the hippocratic oath (in my opnion). Which I just found out right now... that the modern version actually does not contain "do no harm", which is actually quite troubling... [Here is some more infomation, if you would like to read about it.](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html) However I feel that the Board of Directors and Mathew Israel most certainly violate this oath regardless of it not being the same oath as exists in popular imagination.

# Hippocratic Oath

>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
>
>I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
>
>I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, **avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.**
>
>I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and **that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.**
>
>I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
>
>I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. **Above all, I must not play at God.**
>
>**I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being**, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
>
>I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
>
>**I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.**
>
>**If I do not violate this oath**, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH: MODERN VERSION, by Louis Lasagna in 1964.

# Who is on the Board of Directors?

[Archived Board of Directors Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20221220070907/https://www.judgerc.org/board-of-directors.html)

As we can see, these are the current, Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as of 2022. We are going to go through each of these peoples histories and find out the extent of political corruption (speculation for legal reasons) and how the fingers of capital are very much... in this "pie". (Speculation for legal reasons) :P

**These files are too big too be uploaded to GitHub, but I have a Dropbox link for people who wish to read them:**

I don't expect many will read any of these, but the preservation of vital infomation is necessary to build a complete arsonal to annihilate Judge Rotenburg Center. And something tells me that JRC let these links die because they would rather make it as hard as possible for people to find out about what this facility actually does, and has done for almost over 50 years now. I consider making these easier to access a nice middle finger towards Mathew Israel and the Board themselves.

[Judge Rotenberg Center also published this on their page](https://web.archive.org/web/20230111021438/https://www.judgerc.org/css.html), after the passing of a [mass bill of bills by the United States Congress,](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2022/12/congress-has-supported-the-fdas-right-to-stoptheshock/) although this does slightly change the agenda of my politcal project... It doesn't change it completetly. There is more work to be done.

Henry Slucki, is an elderly man who has quite a long history, and an undeniably tragic history, as he was a [Jewish Holocaust Survivor](https://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/oral-histories/interviews/woh-fi-0000372/henry-slucki-2013). This fact must be prefaced with the utmost clarifaction that my criticism of Henry Slucki have nothing to do with Judaism or has anything to do with anti-semitic conspiracy theories; because I actually like facts and reason. But I will call Henry somewhat hypocritical for being on the board of directors of JRC while having both his politics and his particular life experiences.

Jeffrey Sánchez is a former Massachusetts representative who once legally defended the facility on account of his nephew being there. To quote a 2007 article by Mother Jones:

> In this battle, Israel has the perfect ally: state Rep. Jeffrey Sanchez, whose nephew Brandon has been in Israel’s care since age 12; Brandon, now 27, is one of Israel’s most challenging cases, with a long record of extremely self-injurious behavior. This is the same Brandon who Israel once shocked more than 5,000 times, prompting him to make a new device that could deliver much more pain. Nevertheless, Brandon’s parents credit Israel with saving their son’s life, and his uncle has helped ensure that no bill banning aversives becomes law.

In 2023, Brandon would either be 32 or 33 years old today; this means of Brandon is still at the facility they would have been 15 years younger back in 2007. Allegedly Brandon Sánchez was the first person to be subjected to shock torture at JRC. This means Brandon has been subjected to these practices for over 20 years, possibly even longer. More than half of their life has been spent at JRC, and their life has been of torture and misery. Yet we are supposed to belive that their poor behaviour wasn't made worse by how they have been treated? 

What is Brandon's story?

We can't know for sure but here is something which seems to match the details of Brandon's personal life even thought it was depersonalised. In the following report he is simply refered to as 'Student 7'. Perhaps by some standards de-anonymising this data might seem immoral, I honestly think that Brandon's story deserves to be heard. If this is not Brandon, than let it be a note of perspective.

> Student 7 was enrolled in special education programs starting at the age of 5, when he attended a 
day program operated by School E. Student 7’s mother reports that he was out of control while there and 
frequently ran nonstop around the classroom. During a weekend respite stay at School E, Student 7
opened a bottle of liquid Mellaril and drank the entire bottle. He ended up in the emergency room and on 
the pediatric unit of a hospital for three days. Student 7 was discharged from School E after one year 
because he was not making any progress and his inappropriate behaviors were increasing.
> 
> Student 7 was then admitted to the same School A that is referred to above. At that point he was 
engaging in 70-80 aggressive and self-injurious behaviors per day. His most severe behaviors included 
biting himself and others, bolting from staff, pinching himself and others and pica. He was discharged 
from School A after 1 year because he was not making progress and his behaviors were increasing.
> 
> Student 7 then spent 7 years at School F. School F’s interventions included the use of group 
dynamics, art, music, academics and the acquisition of communication and daily living skills. During 
Student 7’s stay at School F, he made significant progress in learning daily living skills but his severe 
maladaptive behaviors impeded continuous growth in all other areas. He would often have tantrums 
involving violent aggressive outbursts and health dangerous behaviors such as frequently bolting from 
teachers and engaging in pica. Student 7’s mother was unable to control his severely dangerous behaviors 
when he was at home during vacation periods. He would stay awake during the night hours and engage in 
pica, ingesting household items such as motor oil, detergents, bleach, plants, lead paint and deodorant. On 
one occasion, Student 7 assaulted his brother while his bother was driving a moving vehicle. During 
Student 7’s vacation periods he repeatedly chewed on the woodwork in his mother’s house.
> 
> School F was unable to treat Student 7 successfully and at age 12 he was removed and enrolled in 
School G. While at School G the frequency and intensity of his dangerous behaviors began to increase. 
He recurrently targeted younger children and females with intense aggression, often biting and scratching 
them. These outbursts were sometimes without antecedents and appeared premeditated. He would wait 
for the staff member or peer to turn his or her back to him and then aggress. Antecedents or situations 
likely to bring about behavioral outbursts included placing demands on him, telling him “no”, and 
denying him a food item that he desired. Because he attacked his family when at home, he could not go 
on regular home visits or on community trips with them.
> 
> One of the principal interventions used at School G involved escorting him to a secluded area subsequent to an aggressive or health dangerous episode and prompting him into a seated position. In this 
area he often would bite his hand or bang his head while moaning. On several occasions it required 
additional staff support to contain him in this area because he attempted to assault the staff. If these 
episodes occurred while at his group home, Student 7 would be escorted to an empty room and be left 
unattended. Once there, he often destroyed the blinds in the room, bit himself and continually got out of 
his seat. In addition Student 7 engaged in frequent disruptive and noncompliant behaviors such as 
screaming, refusing to follow directions or respond to physical prompts, disrobing, and masturbating in 
public. While at School G, he was prescribed Risperdal, which was also unsuccessful in treating his 
behaviors.
> 
> In April 2003, Student 7, now age 16, was admitted to JRC. Figure 7 shows the monthly totals of 
Student 7’s most dangerous behaviors.
>

> 
> Figure 7. The effect of contingent skin-shock on the aggressive, health dangerous, major disruptive, 
destructive, and noncompliant behaviors of Student 7.
> 
> When Student 7 was admitted to JRC he was treated with positive-only programming for over six months. 
During this period there was no deceleration in his problem behaviors and he was engaging in a mean of 
1,753 dangerous and disruptive behaviors per month. After these six months of positive-only 
programming, contingent skin-shock was added to Student 7’s treatment. Student 7’s health dangerous, 
aggressive, destructive, major disruptive and noncompliant behaviors then showed an immediate 
decrease. If we once again ignore the skin-shock insertion month shown in the inset, the jump down is 
from 1,476 per month (last full baseline month) to 92 per month (first full treatment month), dividing by a 
factor of 16. Thereafter the behavior decelerated over the next 15 months to 2 or 3 per month. During the 
last three years he has exhibited a mean of only 6.8 problem behaviors per month.
> 
> In addition to these behavioral improvements, Student 7 advanced academically and socially. As of October, 2003 when skin-shock was inserted into his program, Student 7 was able to participate in 
community outings and weekly field trips to places such as museums, amusement center, and restaurants 
and was able to go on frequent home visits with his family.

This story is from the ['Seven Case Studies of Individuals Expelled from Positive-Only Programs'](#Publications) resource.

There is so much to be said about Jeffery and his involvement which was instrumental in the defence of JRC from legal scrutiny in 2012. But there is a slight rabbit hole in regards to Rasky Partners. Rasky Partners is a lobbying firm which Jeffery is a Senor Advisor at; yet Rasky Partners has no such mention of him, Jeffery is interesting as he is the only member of the board of directors to have little detail provided, as in only his name is provided. I presume this is because it is a corruption rabbit hole. The classic post-service cushy job comes to mind.

Rasky Partners on their website talks about their success stories, and one of them seems particularly interesting, such as [Confidential Healthcare Contractor](https://web.archive.org/web/20230724054258/https://rasky.com/success-stories/confidential-healthcare-contractor) which is described as the following:

> Our team provided strategic communications counsel and support to a healthcare company facing high-profile media scrutiny and potential litigation for its work supporting a state’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
>
> Working alongside the company’s legal counsel, we helped prepare for potential litigation and dispel myths surrounding the company’s work through the delivery of coordinated messaging to key audiences.  Our team worked with the company’s spokespeople to prepare them for briefings with reporters and other stakeholders.  We also developed supporting materials for the company’s internal communications and government relations efforts.
>
> Through a series of background briefings conducted with key media, the company was able to get its core message into news coverage and in front of key audiences without appearing to be defensive or overly aggressive.

This is all particularly spicy and seems to ring a bell. Especially considering the on-going legal battle between JRC and the FDA. While there is no way to actually confirm that Rasky Partners is talking about JRC, the chances are quite high that they are possibly refering to JRC. Researching this made we want to check US deformation laws and USA-Australian extradition laws, there is more of that where that comes from.
