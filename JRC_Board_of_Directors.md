# Intro

This is a formalised exposé of the Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as you can see below, and also there will be a section dedicated the founder Mathew Isreal who is a man who should be viewed in similar regard to [Josef Mengele](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele) or even [Hans Aspberger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/hans-asperger-aided-and-supported-nazi-programme-study-says) himself. But lets not get ahead of ourselves... Why is Mathew no longer on the board, and who are these other people, and what role do they play?

**Important Note:** All sources that are directly in the control of JRC will be archived and screenshots, so we do not increase web traffic towards JRC, which means that increased foot traffic wont ring any alarm bells if they could link back to this GitHub. And if those bastards ever try any defermation suits they can bite my ass because everything I say here is just the truth. I have no need to warp reality, these bastards have already been condemned by the [United Nations](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/a909d4b5254b4ddf75764431cd8352c5ce3ede68/Page%2083%20&%2084%20of%20report-of-the-special-rapporteur-on-torture.pdf) and are all complicit in what I would personally in my opinion consider, [Crimes Against Humanity](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/b031c722d63ae60aaea27c685a50a3d36a064864/Page%2010%20&%2011%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court.pdf), as defined by the United Nations themselves.
