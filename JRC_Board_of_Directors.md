# Intro

This is a formalised exposé of the Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as you can see below, and also there will be a section dedicated the founder Mathew Isreal who is a man who should be viewed in similar regard to [Josef Mengele](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele) or even [Hans Aspberger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/hans-asperger-aided-and-supported-nazi-programme-study-says) himself. But lets not get ahead of ourselves... Why is Mathew no longer on the board and who are these other people, and what role do they play?
