# Intro

This is a formalised exposé of the Board of Directors of Judge Rotenburg Center, as you can see below, and also there will be a section dedicated the founder Mathew Isreal who is a man who should be viewed in similar regard to [Josef Mengele](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele) or even [Hans Aspberger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/hans-asperger-aided-and-supported-nazi-programme-study-says) himself. But lets not get ahead of ourselves... Why is Mathew no longer on the board, and who are these other people, and what role do they play?

All sources that are directly in the control of JRC will be archived and screenshots, so we do not increase web traffic towards JRC, which means that increased foot traffic wont ring any alarm bells if they could link back to this GitHub. And if those bastards ever try any defermation suits they can bite my ass because everything I say here is just the truth. I have no need to warp reality, these bastards have already been condemned by the [United Nations](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/a909d4b5254b4ddf75764431cd8352c5ce3ede68/Page%2083%20&%2084%20of%20report-of-the-special-rapporteur-on-torture.pdf) and are all complicit in what I would personally in my opinion consider, [Crimes Against Humanity](https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/b031c722d63ae60aaea27c685a50a3d36a064864/Page%2010%20&%2011%20of%20the%20Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court.pdf), as defined by the United Nations themselves.

For this reason, I refuse to respect the Doctor titles of any of these individuals as they break the sacred vowels of the hippocratic oath (in my opnion). Which I just found out right now... that the modern version actually does not contain "do no harm", which is actually quite troubling... [This is it, if you would like to read it.](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) However I feel that the Board of Directors and Mathew Israel most certainly violate this oath regardless of it not being the same oath as exists in popular imagination.

> I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.
> I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
