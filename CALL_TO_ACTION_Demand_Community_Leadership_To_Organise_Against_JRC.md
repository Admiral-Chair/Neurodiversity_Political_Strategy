# [13th of December 2022 DRAFT]

# CALL TO ACTION: Demand community leadership to help organise and direct a mass movement against Judge Rotenburg Center!

Hello this isn't you standard post. This is something I am incredibly passionate about and really would like to see something actually happen because quite frankly people don't actually realise what could be done. People don't realise how much could be achieved. People do not realise our collective power.

I want to help stir up a frenzy for us to taste our first blood, and if you don't know what I mean this cryptic opening is to explain just the lengths of frustration about this issue.

Neurodiversity needs to achieve a real world victory able to drive mainstream attention. I am fully ideologically committed to the cause of Neurodiversity. And we need to show what we are capable of, to mainstream society and even to ourselves. All of my ideas are suggestions and ideological fervor, but hopefully my passion is intoxicating and contagious.

# THE DEPLORABLE AND MORAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF DEFENDING JRC:

Judge Rotenburg Center is literally impossible to defend, there is literally no one on this planet with a conscious willing to defend it. Not anti-vaxers, not 4Chan incels, not us, not any Neurotypical or Neurodivergent.

Judge Rotenburg Center only survives off obscurity and lots of money from wealthy and terrible organisations such as Autism $peaks, which the dollar sign is of course quite representative of, the defenders of Judge Rotenburg Center are incapable of flinging of even the slightest of scrutiny to the masses. The masses are on our side, they just don't know about the facility, or it's dealings.

Judge Rotenburg Center is a parasite, and it's board of directors is led by parasites, such as one member who is a high up board member on a local bank with 60 billion dollars in material assets. A person who runs an ABA clinic chain, someone running for president of the ABA association, someone who wrote papers with no citations, on the possible application of ABA on "transsexuals", and of course... Who can forget a local representative who defended the facility and claimed his a extended family member who was there was "getting help they needed"... Coincidentally after that representative left office, they ended up on the board of directors.

How do I know all of this? Because I did the barest amount of research on the board of directors. None of this is hidden, just obscure. I will provide sources when i have done writing this because I am using my phone. But my point is clear... A corrupt facility, defended by a monstrous organisation... That tortures kids? How hard would it actually be to cause a mainstream fuss about it?

# WE ARE NOT A SINGLE VOICE IN THE VOID, WE ARE AN OCEAN OF CHANGE CRASHING AGAINST OUR ENEMIES:

Think about the Neurodivergent community for a second? We have an army of neurotypes and perspectives, we have our allies in the rest of the disability rights movement to back us up, and we have strong ties with affiliated social and political movements from the LGBT, to feminism, to the most radical leftists. Intersectionality, we have an unstoppable wave of allies an possible affiliates, who are already well organised and ready for a fight.

If the LGBT fights to end gay conversion therapy, they will stand with us against JRC.

If feminists fight to end patriarchal oppression, they will stand with us to fight against the oppressive norms that JRC wishes to impose on society.

If racial and ethnic minority communities stand against racial injustice... Umm just look at the demographic statistics of JRC... Mostly minorities... Hence safe to say they're on board.

If Marxists and far leftists hate capital... Well our enemies have plenty. Plus it's kinda their job to show solidarity.

Think of any other social movement, and they also have a place in this fight. If we attack them on all fronts we will decimate JRC.

# HOW DO WE START THE FIRE? HOW DO WE PROCEED?:

Intercommunity alliance, an intersectional alliance.

It first must start by getting the moderators of this sub to agree to try and reach out to as many communities as possible. What... Do you think even the mods of r/ADHD would turn this idea down if they were approached by r/autism? We're basically comrades even if we don't agree on everything. This intersectional alliance wouldn't be for petty online squabbles, it would be for one singular purpose... SALT THE EARTH THAT JUDGE ROTENBURG CENTER SITS! And in that case we can agree. Besides if we get our first taste of blood, maybe we can help out ADHD rights advocacy with the medication shortages, or other such efforts. I don't think people truly realise how many people are in our communities, and it would take a mere fraction of us to get #StoptheShock trending. Think about that... And #StoptheShock isn't the end of this discussion... It's literally our opening move to a flurry of plays and moves to create a united front of the entire Neurodiversity community and beyond.

# What should key objectives be?

1. Create a network of subreddit moderators, to brainstorm and coordinate plans and community operations.
2. Allow community involvement and democracy to get suggestions and ideas from community members on what would be a good idea to organise. (On each individual subreddits and mods bring ideas to the network table)
3. Successfully coordinate memetic strikes against Judge Rotenburg Center.
4. Understand the importance of long term longevity of the movement to prevent burnout or the phenomenon of everyone going back to brunch after a victory and not continuing Neurodiversity struggle.
5. Successfully coordinate operations with already existing movements.
6. A Intersectional Neurodiversity Network must not make partisan issues issues to solve at the network table as anti-factionalism is a key doctrine. Any and all partisan issues among the disability rights movements must be solved elsewhere and shouldn't be dragged into network discussions.
7. Attempt to bring in YouTubers, and non-reddit communities into the fold. In an attempt to broaden the scope of network operations.
8. NEVER TALK TO THE MEDIA IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEDIA TRAINING! This is essential, do not forget what happened to r/antiwork, do not let it happen to us. And if you talk to the media... MAKE SURE IT'S MEDIA YOU KNOW THAT IS OUTRIGHT SUPPORTIVE OF OUR GOAL AND UNDERSTANDS AND HELPS YOU WITH LACK OF MEDIA TRAINING!
9. Once such network is strong enough, attempt to formalise it into an inherent institution of our movement. This means we are far more centralised then other online movements, which gives us a greater ability to coordinate and possibly even move up to outdoors mass movements if possible.
10. This is explicitly an attempt to create a Neurodiversity political force with grass roots foundations and policy direction. Interpersonal drama is an explicit threat to the movement and all must remember that this should beyond specific individuals and this is towards a collective struggle for a brighter future. This doesn't mean organisers should all be on best terms and should sit through discomfort. But mod teams themselves engage with other mod teams as one, to prevent interpersonal flare up. Your loyalty is to your sub consistency and the movement. Don't let it be personal, by engaging as groups.
11. Mental Health breaks are IMPORTANT, we understand that moderators are Human and all of this would be lots of pressure. Ideally for the most user participation and retention of mass and collective action, spacing out these strikes or operations is an essential part to maintaining the passion of such a movement. So in a same light, this also applies to the top level of the network, DO NOT overwork and burn yourselves out. The key here is that once we beat JRC, we keep fighting. JRC allows our movement to have a baptism in fire. If we beat JRC it must be remembered this is just the beginning.
12. Doomerism and apathy is defeat. We must remember that the modern world as we know it was built on movements and struggles just like these. Look to the past for inspiration and pride. Remember Stonewall, remember the suffrage movement, the right to vote, the 8 hour work day... Maybe not all of these even apply some some of our comrades of brains countries, but when I look at Bastille day or the 13th Amendment in the United States, I do not see them as a national struggle, I see them as Humanist struggle in general. In an international sense I find pride in our Human trials against Human tyranny. Maybe you have a different perspective. But remember this... People have faced worse odds and come out on top. REMEMBER THIS AND INTERNALISE THIS!
13. SOLIDARITY FOREVER! This is simple, but we must internalise this phrase.

# WHAT MUST WE DO RIGHT NOW?:

I call on all who feel similar on this or have been touched or impassioned by this idea... To stand with me in calling for the the moderators of r/autism to consider this proposal and this idea. I know many of us are extremely passionate about this subject as I am. And I hope I did a convincing enough job at showing just how we as simple netizens could make a huge difference. If this lights the spark I will be forever grateful that I wrote this today. If not, I will still be grateful that I did what is the best with in my abilities to try and call for organisation.

This truly would be a HUGE feat of social engineering, (in a good way), and also prove as a basis of how online organisation could work within the mass communities of reddit.

# What I encourage from fellow community members:

1. Meme War

Meme war does sound silly, but do not underestimate what a meme war can do. Memes are in a sense modern propaganda, and we must be honest that those who take part are themselves propagandists which isn't inherently negative. Memes could be normal memes and macros, or art and copypastas. Meme war is legitimately an effective tactic in the modern world. Make sure to weaponize it to its fullest potential. In calling for organisation of the communities and the proceeding strikes and operations preceding it.

2. Make essays, videos, comments, posts, music, games, and art. Weaponize talent.

If we are to build a movement we need lots of ideas, formalised ideas that can change peoples minds and perspectives. Remember who we are for a second, the autistic community, so many people with amazing and quite hyper specific talents. Weaponize your talent for our struggle. But most importantly, get the word around.

3. EDUCATE AND AGITATE!

This is simple, be really annoying about this, when you can, educate people about JRC, and agitate our positions when possible.

4. Don't burn yourself out.

Just like for the previous list, sustain your passion by doing it when you feel like it, not when you don't feel as such. Our success relies on all of us sustaining our siege until we reach a better world. Not just climbing a few steps.

5. Diplomacy and Optics

You aren't forced to police your tone, this is only my suggestions. But generally speaking people are more amenable to your ideas when you put it in a tone they appreciate. This is merely a point of tactics. But never personally attack anyone you are trying to educate or agitate to, because they will be less receptive.

6. Understand and have a grasp of how algorithms work and drive attention.

This means you can spread you ideas more effectively, such as posting during the most effective times pf the day, having catchy or eye grabbing works or thumbnails. And generally anything that helps boost the amount of eyes that skim around your activism.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS:

If you made it to the end of this... Congratulations, I legitimately have no idea how I wrote this much. But if you have any counter suggestions or even criticisms I strongly encourage people to share them. And I strongly encourage everything leave their thoughts no matter how small or if they just say "this!". Call it... Playing to the algorithm, but yes I really do be e-begging out here. But the karma or upvotes is not what I seek... I SEEK ACTION AND PROGRESS! Do you really think I would spend hours writing this just for the karma? No my request for algorithmic boost is part of my ideological goal of trying to get the mods to read this and see the importance of such an idea. If you are with similar convictions, spread this far and wide. Like I said, the struggle is more important then anything interpersonal.

However to be honest it would put a smile on my face. But that's just me being honest.

And lets really be honest! I AM EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS! :D

Hopefully this clears up most if not everything I have to say except... A few ideological catch phrases I really like.

# INFINITY YEARS FOR NEURODIVERSITY!

# VIVA LA RESISTANCE!

# LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND FRATERNITY FOR ALL!

# STOP THE SHOCK!

# SEND MATHEW ISRAEL TO THE HAGUE!

# JUSTICE FOR 50 YEARS OF TERROR, AND JUSTICE FOR 50 YEARS OF INACTION!

Okay. That's all of them.

And finally...

I truly thank all of you! Every single one of you, in this community and all Neurodivergent communities, for all of the love, compassion, support, and information you guys have provided me in my last couple years! I thank HowToADHD for helping me begin my journey into my long neglected diagnosed ADHD, and I couldn't have actually got to this point in my life without all of you fine comrades of brain on reddit.

I truly consider this to be my love letter to celebrate all of us and all of our past, present, and future accomplishments!

I love you all! <3

Forever and ever, INFINITY TO NEURODIVERSITY!
