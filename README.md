# Neurodiversity Political Strategy
A repository discussing potential political strategy for the Neurodiversity social movement. What I propose is bottom up coalition with democratic and centralised characteristics. This would help ensure the viability of a continued Neurodivergent and Disability rights movement in a way that protects the movement from fatigue or the "pack it up" mentality which has disintegrated Human rights movements across the board. We must secure the Infinite push for Neurodiversity for a society that finally accepts the diversity of minds and brains. Regardless of ability!
